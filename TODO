This file contains the TODO milestones for Bio::Metabolic.

+ => Met
- => Not met


- Matrix caclulations in Bio::Metabolic::MatrixOps need more tests
  (t/06matrixops)

- Some important matrix calculations have to be incorporated, such as
        - check whether a network's stoichiometry allows for the
	  interconversion of given substrates.
        - determine a minimal set of extrernal metabolites

- Permanent storage of the data has to be achieved. I am not sure yet how to
  incorporate this. I have several routines that fiddle around with a MySQL
  database. However, they are all a bit shaky and inefficient.

- Interfaces to available metabolic databases, especially KEGG

+ So far the module depends on Math::Symoblic. In many cases a symbolic
  representation of the reaction rates etc. is not needed (i.e. if only
  stoichiometric properties are investigated). I plan to lump all these
  methods into one package that can be loaded separately.
  DONE! These methods are now in Bio::Metabolic::Dynamics
